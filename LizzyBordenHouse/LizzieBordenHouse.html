        <figcaption> Many murders occured right after <br /> walking through this bedroom. For <br /> example, after Lizzie's Step Mother <br /> walked through this room, she was <br /> the first to be murdered within <br /> the house. She was killed inside <br /> the front bedroom, while fixing <br /> the bed that John Morse had <br /> slept in the prior night. </figcaption>

    <h2><u><b> The Guests thoughts on the Lizzie Borden House! </b></u></h2>
        
        <h3> "Excellent Tour" </h3>
        
        <blockquote> "The tour guide was wonderful and she made the tour very enjoyable. The house is very much as it was when Lizzie and her family lived. There were many doubts that remained as to whether or not Lizzie killed her Dad and step-Mom. The story was fascinating and our guide made the story come alive." </blockquote>
        
        <h3> "Great Experience" </h3>
        
        <blockquote> "Great to finally be able to see the house, I have wanted to visit for years. Our tour guide Jack was fantastic. He presented the tour information in a way that you were able to draw your own conclusions about the case. Facility was very clean and management was very welcoming." </blockquote>
        
        <h3> "I thought I knew the story!"</h3>
        <blockquote> "As a child, I learned the "Lizzie Borden took an ax" rhyme, and I thought I knew the whole story behind these violent murders. Boy, was I wrong! I took the daytime tour of the Lizzie Borden home 3 days ago, and I'm still thinking about all that happened there. Sue St. John was our guide, and she was excellent. As we walked through each room of the house, recreated from old photos to look as they did in 1892, she told us about the events leading up to the murders in great detail and pointed out fascinating pictures (such as the picture of the jury at Lizzie's trial) and articles in the rooms. By the end of the hour long tour, Sue managed to confirm what I thought I knew about the crime and also raise doubts about the perpetrator. I hated to see the tour end!" </blockquote>

        <h2><u><b> What this location offers </b></u></h2>
        <p> If you are travelling to the area, or even if you live in Massachussetts, I suggest going to the Lizzie Borden House, and possibly sleeping over night. Although children under 5 years old are not welcomed to sleep over because they are too young, this is a great family event. Children and even adults are spooked by the stories of this house, and sometimes say that they thought they knew the story! The Lizzie Borden House offers house tours and a bed and breakfast, with 8 rooms offered for stay. In addition, the house toors are offered 363 days a year, and almost everyone who comes out of the house is so freaked out by the murder cases! </p>
